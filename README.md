## Dialects

* [bootBASIC](https://github.com/nanochess/bootBASIC) - a BASIC language in 512 bytes of x86 machine code. 
* [Bywater BASIC Interpreter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/) - implements a large superset of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) and a significant subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987) in C.
* [Chipmunk Basic](http://www.nicholson.com/rhn/basic/) - an interpreter for the BASIC Programming Language. It runs on multiple OS platforms, and is reasonably fast for a pure interpreter. Chipmunk Basic presents a traditional (vintage) terminal-command-line programming environment, and supports a simple, old-fashioned, and easy-to-learn dialect of the Basic Programming Language. (Line numbers are required when using the built-in command-line console, but are not required in Basic programs written using an external text editor.) The language also supports a few advanced extensions. Free for educational and personal use.
* [FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/) - a free/open source (GPL), BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, DOS and Linux. 
* [Just BASIC](https://justbasic.com/) - a programming language for Windows.  It is completely free and it is suitable for creating all kinds of applications for business, industry, education and entertainment.
* [Gambas](http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html) - a free development environment and a full powerful development platform based on a Basic interpreter with object extensions, as easy as Visual Basic
* [MatrixBrandy](https://github.com/stardot/MatrixBrandy) - a Fork of Brandy BASIC V for Linux. Brandy implements Basic VI, the the 64-bit floating-point mathematics variant of the dialect of Basic that Acorn Computers supplied with their ranges of desktop computers that use the ARM processor such as the Archimedes and RiscPC. Basic V and VI are an extended version of BBC Basic. This was the Basic used on the BBC Micro that Acorn made during the early 1980s.
* [Oxygen Basic](https://www.oxygenbasic.org/) - a Compact embeddable JIT compiler that reads C headers and compiles to x86 machine code. Executes directly in memory or creates DLLs and EXE files. Supports overloading and OOP. Currently available for MS platforms.
* [QB64](https://www.qb64.org/portal/) - a modern extended BASIC programming language that retains QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5 compatibility and compiles native binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS
* [SmallBASIC](https://smallbasic.github.io/) - a fast and easy to learn BASIC language interpreter ideal for everyday calculations, scripts and prototypes. SmallBASIC includes trigonometric, matrices and algebra functions, a built in IDE, a powerful string library, system, sound, and graphic commands along with structured programming syntax.
* [thinBASIC](https://www.thinbasic.com/) - a very fast "BASIC like" programming language useful to Beginners and to Gurus. BASIC interpreter for Windows able to create console and gui applications with most of the user interface controls, automate process, automate data exchange, connect to databases, send mails, connect to ftp sites, rest api, parsing strings, tokenizing, traversing xml, handling files, Windows Registry, OpenGl, graphics, sound, printing ... and much more.
* [X11-Basic](http://x11-basic.sourceforge.net/) - a dialect of the BASIC programming language with graphics and sound.
* [YAB](https://github.com/bbjimmy/Yab) - a complete BASIC programming language for [Haiku](https://www.haiku-os.org/). Yab allows fast prototyping with simple and clean code. yab contains a large number of BeAPI specific commands for GUI creation and much, much more. yab-IDE is a powerful development environment, which of course is programmed in yab itself.
* [Yabasic](http://www.yabasic.de/) - a traditional basic-interpreter. It comes with goto and various loops and allows to define subroutines and libraries. It does simple graphics and printing. Yabasic can call out to libraries written in C and allows to create standalone programs. Yabasic runs under Unix and Windows and has a comprehensive documentation; it is small, simple, open-source and free. 

## Game Development

* [BlitzMax](https://blitzmax.org/) - a fast cross-platform, open-source, programming language.
* [Cerberus X](https://www.cerberus-x.com/community/portal/) - Aa cross-platform development toolset which serves 2D game development at its core. Cerberus X is a fork of the Monkey X programming language.

## IDEs, Editors, Plugins, and Tools

* [BaCon](https://www.basic-converter.org/) - a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems, which runs on most Unix/Linux/BSD platforms, including MacOSX. It intends to be a programming aid in creating tools which can be compiled on different platforms (including 64bit environments), while trying to revive the days of the good old BASIC.
* [basgo](https://github.com/udhos/basgo) - compiles BASIC-lang to Golang.
* [DavsIDE](http://www.qbasicnews.com/dav/projects.php#DAVSIDE) - an Alternative IDE for the QB64 compiler. 
* [InForm](https://www.qb64.org/inform/) - a GUI engine and WYSIWYG interface designer for QB64.
* [PC-BASIC ](https://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic/) - a free, cross-platform interpreter for GW-BASIC, Advanced BASIC (BASICA), PCjr Cartridge Basic and Tandy 1000 GWBASIC.
* [WinFBE](https://github.com/PaulSquires/WinFBE) - FreeBASIC Editor for Windows.
* [wwwBASIC](https://github.com/google/wwwbasic) - an implementation of BASIC that runs on Node.js and the Web.
